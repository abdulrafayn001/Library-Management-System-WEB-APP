            Library Management System is a Web Application that is used to manage and store the details of books and the users. In
            this Web Application, we have two types of users, admin, and students. Students can register and log in. After
            successful login, a student can see all the available books in the library. Students can also search books by their name
            and category. When a student takes any book from the library, the information of the book with student details and due
            date will automatically store in the database and update on the webpage. The student can also request a book. All the
            information about borrowed books, total books pending to be returned, and total fine is also shown on the student
            dashboard. Students can also change its password. Admins have their dashboard where they can add or remove books from
            the database. They can also change their password. They can also add or remove any student.
